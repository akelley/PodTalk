# Podtalk
 
Podtalk is a podcast-sharing, social networking application where people can talk about, listen to and keep up to date with their favorite podcasts. Users can build a profile that displays their user info, commments, favorite podcasts and episodes.

This app utilizes the iTunes Search API and converts each podcast's RSS feed into JSON. The JSON data is then used to build pages for individual podcasts and podcast episodes and display their descriptions, release dates, MP3s and conversation threads.

Frontend: React.js, Express.js, Node.js
